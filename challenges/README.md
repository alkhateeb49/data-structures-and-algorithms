# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used for loop and array to bring it

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used 2 for loops first one to put same half value, and the second one to put the remaining values, between them i added the new value.

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I utilized Binary Search to find the target value in the array using while and if statment.
